# LineFollower

This project is a line-following robot implemented using LEGO Mindstorms EV3. The robot is designed to follow a colored line on the ground by using color sensors and a PID controller.

## Features

- **Color Sensor Calibration**: The robot can calibrate its color sensors to detect the line and the background.

- **PID Control**: It uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to maintain its position relative to the line.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up your LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot and connect it to your computer.

3. Compile and upload the program to the robot using the appropriate software (e.g., EV3DEV, EV3 Software, etc.).

4. Start the robot and have him learn the color of the track line and the background.

5. Place it on the track.

5. The robot should follow the line autonomously, adjusting its position as needed.
